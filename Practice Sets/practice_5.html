                    What's a tree ?

                        A tree is a plant with a tall structure comprised of a stem and branches to support leaves, and a
                        root system than anchors the stem as well as procures and stores essential growth elements
                        such as water and nutrients. Trees are unique from other plants because they can and usually
                        do live for decades and up to several millennia ( the oldest known single-stem tree is a baobab
                        in South Africa measured to be 6000 years old), grow successive layers of woody vascular tissue
                        that is added from growth just under the bark to develop woody stems, and in most parts of
                        the Earth grow taller than surface vegetation, ranging in height from several meters up to
                        115.55 meters (the tallest recorded tree is a giant redwood in northern California). A tree stem
                        is unique from other plant forms in that its woody stem growth occurs from a thin strip of cells
                        called the cambium located just under the outer bark. Each year the cambium produces layers
                        of new growth to the outside and inside. Growth to the outside is called the phloem and
                        consists of large diameter cells designed to conduct sugar water from the leaves down the stem
                        to the rest of the tree. Because of their large diameter, phloem cells are structurally weak and
                        collapse after a year or two and are pushed outwards in compacted layers to become the outer
                        bark. Growth to the inside is called the sapwood and functions as a living water transport
                        system from the roots to the leaves and a storage site for surplus sugar and starch. As sapwood
                        ages it becomes a depository for secondary metabolite materials such as phenols and terpenes.
                        Eventually older sapwood dies and becomes the dead central core of tree called the
                        heartwood. Deposited materials also make the heartwood of many tree species toxic to fungi
                        and microorganisms which is why lumber cut from tree heartwood is often more durable than
                        the nutrient rich sapwood. All trees have these key characteristics, although their stem
                        shapes, wood composition, leaf shape and overall form can vary significantly.

                    Why plant a tree ?

                        Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff,
                        which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.
                        Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and

                    Are trees really that important ?

                    Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air quality, climate amelioration, 
                    conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. During the process of photosynthesis, trees 
                    take in carbon dioxide and produce the oxygen we breathe.
